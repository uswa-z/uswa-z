## Hi there 👋

<!--
**uswa-z/uswa-z** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I'm Uswa, a cybersecurity analyst based in Spain.

I design and build helpful integral security prototypes.

If I am to be faced with an issue, chances are I'll plan and execute its solution.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, SQL, and CISCO. My ideal tools are Nessus, Axcrypt and Wireshark on my Desktop.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favourite is the [no-idea](https://github.com/uswa-z/no-idea)

I've built over 100 public repos, but privately... its probably more than 200 at this point.

If you want to learn how I do it, [my books and courses](https://github.com/uswa-z/no-idea) are available here!

**Fun Facts:**

   * I don't like coffee

   * I'm bilingual
  
   * I'm the oldest daughter

   * Hobbies: reading, baking, writing
